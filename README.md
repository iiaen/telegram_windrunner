### 📈 Receiving Automated Messages on Telegram 
Using `python` and `cron` to automate the collection and message delivery of the following info to myself on Telegram:
- Daily list of insider purchases (info from SEC Form 4 filings)
- Daily price and volume metrics for a list of tickers
- Candlestick chart for previous day MSFT price and volume data, in 5 minutes intervals  
  
> 🏮 Just for fun only!
